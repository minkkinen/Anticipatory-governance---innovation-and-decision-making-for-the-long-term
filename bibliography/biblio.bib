It provides a definition of the concept and proposes a broad framework for its implementation under research and innovation schemes around the world. The author makes the case that RRI should be understood as a strategy of stakeholders to become mutually responsive to each other, anticipating research and innovation outcomes aimed at the “grand challenges” of our time, for which they share responsibility. Research and innovation processes need to become more responsive and adaptive to these grand challenges. This implies, among others, the introduction of broader foresight and impact assessments for new technologies, beyond their anticipated market-benefits and risks.},

Because nanotechnologies are currently inchoate, even those stakeholders who recognize an interest in them often operate with only loosely formed and sometimes ill-conceived expectations of them. Even so, such projections are essential resources in legitimating and authorizing decision-making. In debates on nanotechnology, the future is “an active arena, one both pregnant and populated with agendas, interests and contestations” (Selin 2007: 214).},

  abstract = {Deliberative democracy now dominates the theory, reform, and study of democracy. Working at its cutting edges, Foundations and Frontiers of Deliberative Governance reaches from conceptual underpinnings to the key challenges faced in applications to ever-increasing ranges of problems and issues. Following a survey of the life and times of deliberative democracy, the turns it has taken, and the logic of deliberative systems, contentious foundational issues receive attention. How can deliberative legitimacy be achieved in large-scale societies where face-to-face deliberation is implausible? What can and should representation mean in such systems? What kinds of communication should be valued, and why? How can competing appeals of pluralism and consensus in democratic politics be reconciled? New concepts are developed along the way: discursive legitimacy, discursive representation, systemic tests for rhetoric in democratic communication, and several forms of meta-consensus. Particular forums (be they legislative assemblies or designed mini-publics) have an important place in deliberative democracy, but more important are macro-level deliberative systems that encompass the engagement of discourses in the public sphere as well as formal and informal institutions of governance. Deliberative democracy can be applied fruitfully in areas previously off-limits to democratic theory: networked governance, the democratization of authoritarian states, and global democracy, as well as in new ways to invigorate citizen participation. In these areas and more, deliberative democracy out-performs its competitors.},

This article provides a framework for the classification and analysis of nodes related to future technological development. Key concepts of the article are “technological generalization” and “leitbild.” The topics in the technology foresight Delphi studies can be seen as different kinds of generalizations from already realized technological developments. Leitbild is a German word. Its most general meaning is a guiding image. Like a common vision, a leitbild creates a shared overall goal, offers orientation toward one long-term overall goal, and provides a basis for different professions and disciplines to work in the same direction. The analysis of leitbilder and emerging technological paradigms might contribute to the construction of topics and issues and to the argumentation processes related to them.},
