Guston defines anticipatory governance as a "broad-based capacity extended through society that can act on a variety oof inputs to manage emerging knowledge-based technologies while such management is still possible" <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>. The starting point is the so-called Collingridge dilemma: first the social consequences of emerging technologies are unclear, and when they become clearer, it is already too late to act on them due to path-dependence and technological lock-in. The basic assumption is the one shared in all foresight work, that early anticipatory action is better than reacting when problems and crises have already emerged.</div><div></div><div>Anticipatory governance aims to build capacities in foresight, engagement and integration <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>In the early 2000s, two strands of literature in anticipatory governance began to emerge: 1) public administration and management, and 2) environmental studies and policy <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Critics have pointed out that the perspective of anticipatory governance may contribute to the hubris of technoscience <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Boenink_2013,Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Ethics is connected to anticipatory governance of emerging technologies in two ways. Firstly, the foresight exercises try to uncover possible future ethical and social issues related to the technology in question. Ethics is thus the connected to the substance of the foresight. Secondly, there are many ethical questions related to the foresight methods that are used, such as stakeholder participation and the use of power. This is the methodological or meta-level ethical element.</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Anticipating ethical controversies</h2><div>Technoethical scenarios (Boenink et al.)</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Participation in governance of emerging technologies</h2><div>The key reason for conducting technology assessment in a participatory and deliberative manner is that non-experts may make sense of technology in unexpected ways <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Selin_2011}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Means of participation: the NanoFutures project created an online discussion forum and a wiki site to test and develop scenarios in an 'open source' manner <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Selin_2011}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Pitfalls of citizen participation: participation actually used as a technique for regulating publics <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012}</cite>.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Case of renewable energy technologies</h1><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Teemoja kirjallisuudesta</h1><div></div>
