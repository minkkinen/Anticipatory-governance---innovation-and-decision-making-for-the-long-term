When Albert Einstein developed the Theory of Relativity, this was a remarkable achievement for astronomy and theoretical physics, and subsequent scientific discoveries. Some 40 years later, although not wished by Einstein himself, his ideas led to the invention and eventual use of the atomic bomb in World War II, and nuclear deterrence in the Cold War. (Then again, such developments may also run vice versa. A fusion bomb, for instance, might be considered as an antecedent, if later there is a breakthrough in fusion energy&nbsp;(Kuusi 2002).</span></div><div>Both anticipation and governance are argued to be necessary, as it is claimed that the&nbsp; radical character and speed of technological change can shape future societies in unpredictable ways. Then again, there is an <span>ongoing conflict in planning systems around  certainty versus flexibility (Steele &amp; Ruming, 2012).      In this paper, our aim is to shed light on the emerging concept of 'anticipatory governance'. The division of work is elaborated in Appendix 1. As a method, our work is based on a literature review through databases (ScienceDirect, Scopus, Google Scholar). Two main literature searches were conducted on Scopus using the following search strings:</span></div><ol><li><span>TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "anticipatory governance" )&nbsp; AND&nbsp; ( LIMIT-TO ( SUBJAREA ,&nbsp; "SOCI" )&nbsp; OR&nbsp; LIMIT-TO ( SUBJAREA ,&nbsp; "BUSI" ) ) (date: 30 January 2017, 34 results)</span></li><li><span>TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "emerging technology"&nbsp; W/10&nbsp; governance ) (date: 22 February 2017, 62 results)</span></li></ol><div><span>The first search yielded the central conceptual papers concerning anticipatory governance, many of which concern emerging technologies. The second search was made to broaden the scope to different aspects of the governance of emerging technologies. The omission of the term 'anticipatory' is justified in the second search because 'emerging technology' already implies a future orientation. Following these searches, supplementary searches were made on ScienceDirect and Google Scholar, and the reference lists of key papers were consulted for additional references.</span></div><div><span>We begin with a short introduction of the origins of anticipation and governance. Next, we explore and define the  anticipatory governance. We then explore its significance for emerging technologies, followed by a section on the means of participation. Furthermore, we move to draw connections of the anticipatory governance approach with foresight and scenario literature (taking note of the dedicated course literature). To conclude, we discuss how anticipatory governance, currently promoted by the likes of Riel Miller and Roberto Poli,&nbsp;relates with futures studies more broadly.</span></div><h1 data-label="555810" class="ltx_title_section">Background - setting the scene</h1><div><i>Anticipation </i>&nbsp;refers to anticipatory behaviour, as a process (or behaviour) that not only depends on past and present but also on predictions, expectations, or beliefs about the future, through cognitive or psychological mechanisms of looking ahead and acting accordingly. Phenomenologists such as Edmund Husserl see anticipation as an essential feature of human action. Anticipation may provide faster adaptivity in dynamic environments with internal reflection and planning, enhance the chances of survival, and is also helpful for social interaction (Butz,&nbsp; Sigaud, and Gérard 2003; Poli 2010). Anticipation, as a scholarly approach, owes to theoretical biology and physics where anticipations are understood to contribute to complexity, life and to stabilize chaotic control processes.&nbsp;An anticipatory system&nbsp;for <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{rosen_anticipatory_1985}</cite> is “one in which present change of state depends upon future&nbsp; circumstances, rather than merely on the present or past”. In almost similar vein, Nadin (2012,&nbsp; xxxiv), sees an anticipatory system as “a system whose current state is determined not only by a past state, but also by possible future states”. Poli (2009, 2010) compares Rosen's and Luhmann's systemic thinking, suggests that anticipatory systems are self-referential, they have a capacity to anticipate their own evolution. For Rosen, anticipation is&nbsp; closely linked with complexity. To measure life is different from all other&nbsp; forms of measurement; to understand life is to acknowledge complexity (Nadin&nbsp; 2012).&nbsp;This seemingly relates anticipatory systems and organisational learning. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{miller2014discipline}</cite> identify four contemporary approaches to anticipation: anticipation&nbsp;in&nbsp; biological, psychological and social systems; anticipation and resilience; anticipation and futures literacy; and anticipatory governance.</div><div><i>Governance </i>(Greek: Kubernân, Latin: gubernare), supposedly more than merely 'muddling through' (Lindblom 1959), is piloting, rule-making or steering, referring to the capacity of government to "steer the society”. The intellectual core of governance theories derives from administrative studies and political science of making and implementing policy&nbsp;(Pierre and Peters 2000). In many western countries, planning systems are&nbsp; undergoing theoretical and methodological change,&nbsp;shaped by a 'push' to escape top-down government approach, compartmentalized regulation (Lyall &amp; Tait, 2005), &nbsp;taking note of planning as a communicative rationality and community-based planning (see Serrao-Neumann et al. 2015).&nbsp;The purpose of foresight, in governance,&nbsp;is to enhance the ability of decision-makers to engage and shape events at a longer range and, to the best advantage of the citizens they serve. Such endeavour is challenged by the short-term imperative of policy and politics. Despite its challenge, the alternative is to practice governance blindly to the longer term implications of&nbsp; decisions&nbsp;(Fuerth 2009).</div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Anticipatory governance</h1><div>In the early 2000s, two strands of literature in&nbsp;<i>anticipatory governance&nbsp;</i> had began to emerge: one of public administration and management, and a second of &nbsp;environmental studies and policy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Karinen_2009,Guston_2014}</cite>. The intellectual ancestor of&nbsp;anticipatory governance is Alvin Toffler's notion of 'anticipatory democracy' in the 1970s, a prescription against a “future shock”. For Toffler, anticipatory democracy meant a process of citizen participation coupled with future consciousness, as explained in a book he edited&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{bezold_anticipatory_1978} </cite>. 30 years later,&nbsp;Bezold revisits anticipatory democracy; it is seen as an aspiration of genuine, enlightened participation with foresight (Bezold 2006) –&nbsp;a mission of overcoming populism and traditionalistic political culture.</div><div>Anticipatory&nbsp; governance distinguishes from Alvin Toffler’s notion of anticipatory democracy in,&nbsp;at least three ways: people are able to actively shape technology rather than become shaped by it; forecasting, linear and predictive models are too unreliable to be trusted; and rather than experts alone, broader groups of people can self-consciously reflect on the values that go into technology. Guston argues that “by deeply engaging ordinary citizens, integrating knowledge across disciplines, and cultivating a broadly anticipatory disposition, we can lessen the shock of the future.” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{guston_muddled_2016} </cite>. Anticipatory governance is distinctive from adaptive governance <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hurlbert_adaptive_2016} </cite>, deliberative governance <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{dryzek_foundations_2012,hendriks_deliberative_2009} </cite>, and reflexive governance <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{vos_reflexive_2006,vos_politics_2011} </cite>. Anticipatory governance, in the context of emerging technologies, means the ways in which research, development, application and use of a technology are developed and steered <cite> <a href="#Read_2015">(Read 2015) </a> </cite>, between adapting to a coming revolution and halting  development <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008} </cite>.</div><div>Products of science and technology do not appear magically, they appear in the hands of people (Sarewitz 2011). Future technologies emerge through technoscientific imaginaries (Wiek and Guston 2012).&nbsp;Emerging&nbsp; technologies can create new industries, transform existing ones - and shape societies, more broadly. Then again, ‘destructive creation’, borrowing from entrepreneurship literature,&nbsp;refers to innovations that do not have a positive impact on the end&nbsp; user (Baumol 1996; Lucas and Fuller 2017).&nbsp;While controlling the direction of innovation may not&nbsp; even be desirable (Sarewitz 2011), responsible, adaptive and integrated&nbsp; management of the innovation process has ‘ethics' as a design principle.&nbsp;Anticipatory governance, motivated by risk and uncertainty, can bring forward engagement, with a whole-of-government (governance) approach to complex issues, to be cultivated as a systemic culture (Fuerth 2009). In relation to innovation and technology, it emerges from a vision of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). This way, anticipatory governance as part of responsible innovation may drive innovation towards 'societal desirable ends' <cite> <a href="#von_schomberg_vision_2013">(von Schomberg 2013) </a> </cite>. Worryingly, in such efforts, sustainability has often been vaguely defined, and anticipatory governance could benefit from being combined with transformational  sustainability science (Wiek and Guston 2012).&nbsp;In addition to providing strategic vision, anticipatory&nbsp; governance can be used as an evaluative tool (Foley et al. 2015).</div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Anticipatory governance of emerging technologies</h1><div>The term anticipatory governance is widely in use in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), particularly with relation to nanotechnology&nbsp;(Barben 2008, Karinen 2009).&nbsp;Anticipatory&nbsp; governance has also been applied on the one hand, to deal with other emerging technologies such as carbon nanotubes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{philbrick_anticipatory_2010}</cite>, geoengineering, synthetic biology&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{wiek_sustainability_2012}</cite>, solar radiation management&nbsp;(Low 2017). On the other hand, this is contextualized through social objectives,&nbsp; such as avoiding climate change or urban development.&nbsp;Anticipatory governance of emerging technologies is a particular approach of technology governance which can be differentiated from reactive governance. Guston defines anticipatory governance as a "broad-based capacity extended through society that can act on a variety of inputs to manage emerging knowledge-based technologies while such management is still possible" <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014} </cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{barben_anticipatory_2008} </cite>&nbsp;(pp. 992-993) use a similar definition: "the ability of a variety of lay and expert stakeholders [...] to collectively imagine, critique, and thereby shape the issues presented by emerging technologies before they become reified in particular ways". What then are these procedural principles  (Wiek and Guston 2012)&nbsp;to collectively influence the&nbsp; development of emerging technologies?</div><div>The terms used in both definitions ("while such management is still possible", "before they become reified") refer to the so-called so-called Collingridge dilemma: first the social consequences of emerging technologies are unclear, and when they become clearer, it is already too late to act on them due to path-dependence and technological lock-in <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a} </cite>. The basic assumption is the one shared in all foresight work, that early anticipatory action is better than reacting later when problems and crises have already emerged. Therefore government agencies and technology developers are increasingly expected to anticipate possible consequences of technology development and to make informed decisions.</div><div>An easy answer to the anticipatory dilemma would be that the design of an innovation itself should be safe. And indeed, emerging technologies often need safeguards from 'evident' identifiable issues. Off-road vehicles did not have rollover protection, environmentally hazardous lead was widely used in gasoline&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{myers_anticipation_2007}</cite>, and the first drone accident is seen only as a matter of time, it is 'anticipated'. Another dilemma are 'unforeseen' impacts of emerging technologies, consequences seen only long after technological development.&nbsp;The harms of asbestos, DDT, or plastic waste in oceans today were only realized decades later.&nbsp;Social media transcends place and provides connectedness, but their algorithms also undermine our ability to focus and potentially undermine productivity. Others have pointed out how the humankind has committed an error with locking into fossil&nbsp; fuel technologies, and how correcting this mistake may now be too late, if at&nbsp; all possible - anymore.</div><div>Anticipatory governance has also been used by the likes of Serrao-Neumann&nbsp; et al. (2013) who look at land-use planning and what adaptive strategies are needed&nbsp; to tackle climate change.</div><div>Anticipatory governance aims to build capacities in foresight (open-ended instead of predictive), engagement and integration (of social science and humanities research&nbsp; with emerging technologies)&nbsp;(Guston 2010) <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014} </cite>.</div><div>Anticipatory governance emerges from distributed social and epistemological capacities, including collective self-criticism, imagination and learning through trial and error <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008} </cite>.</div><div>For instance, critics have pointed out that the perspective of anticipatory governance may contribute to the hubris of technoscience <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Boenink_2013,Guston_2014} </cite>.&nbsp;Another challenge of anticipatory  governance is that new science/knowledge is constantly produced.</div><div></div><div>In the following sections, we will discuss central themes which we have identified from the literature on anticipatory governance. We have chosen participation as the overarching theme because it brings together many of the more specific issues related to anticipatory governance of emerging technologies.</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Participation in governance of emerging technologies</h2><div>Participation is a key theme in anticipatory governance of emerging technologies. Some level of participation is implicit already in the governance concept, and the future orientation adds another layer of participation, as foresight is usually envisioned as a participatory process. Governance of emerging technologies is an increasingly multi-actor exercise. In particular, citizens and civil society actors are expected to participate in the development of emerging technologies from an early stage ('upstream' engagement) <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015} </cite>. In general terms, actors can be divided into government actors, industry actors and civil society actors. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Wiek_2007} </cite> expand this categorization to include 10 types of actors in the case of nanotechnology: industry, consultants, insurers, investors, public research institutes, government regulatory agencies, government research funding agencies, NGOs and media. In any case, the actor network is complex.</div><div>The three pillars of anticipatory governance (foresight, engagement and integration) were mentioned earlier. This section focuses specifically on the engagement part, raising key themes and issues that were found in the literature search. Engagement is a rising trend in anticipatory governance of emerging technologies, at least on the level of discourse.&nbsp;In recent decades, participation in governance of technologies has evolved from increasing the public's level of knowledge, a one-way educating activity, into engaging the public in a two-way dialogue <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012} </cite>. In a discussion of styles of governance, <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Read_2015} </cite>&nbsp;unite 'anticipatory' and 'open' into the same style of governance, meaning broad stakeholder participation and identifying emerging risks and opportunities. The other style of governance is formal, reactive and closed. Involving citizens early in the design process is expected to contribute new perspectives, experiences and dilemmas <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015} </cite>. One key reason for conducting technology assessment in a participatory and deliberative manner is that non-experts may make sense of technology in unexpected ways <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Selin_2011} </cite>.</div><div>As one example, in research workshops, students or researchers may align their research towards more socially valuable targets <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{karinen_toward_2009} </cite> (Karinen and Guston 2010)</div><div>However, participation is not a simple solution and as is common with wicked problems, the solutions may raise new ethical issues. As <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Sturgis_2014} </cite> puts it, "as the participatory movement attempts the awkward transition from high theory to complex and messy practice, a number of dilemmas are encountered which problematise the notion of public engagement as a potential solution to the 'wicked' problems of science governance". On the general level, participatory governance of emerging technologies is 'ethical' in two senses. Firstly, the foresight exercises try to uncover possible future ethical and social issues related to the technology&nbsp;in question. Secondly, there are ethical questions related to the participatory methods that are used, such as unequal distribution of power. There are even arguments for challenging the exercise of anticipatory governance.&nbsp;For instance, critics have pointed out that the perspective of anticipatory governance may contribute to the hubris of technoscience (Boenink 2013, Guston 2014).</div><div></div><div></div>
