<div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div><i>Anticipation</i>, as anticipatory behaviour, is a process, or behaviour, that not only&nbsp; depends on past and present but also on predictions, expectations, or beliefs about&nbsp; the future, through cognitive or psychological mechanisms of looking ahead and acting accordingly. For phenomenologists such as Edmund Husserl, anticipation is  an essential feature of human action. Anticipation may provide&nbsp; faster adaptivity in dynamic environments with internal reflection and planning, enhance the chances of survival, and is also helpful for social interaction (Butz,&nbsp; Sigaud, and Gérard 2003; Poli 2010). In theoretical biology and physics anticipations are understood to contribute to complexity, life and to stabilize chaotic control processes. Anticipation relates to organisational learning. In its classic definition, an anticipatory system contains “a predictive model of&nbsp; itself and/or its environment, which allows it to change state at an instant in&nbsp; accord with the model’s predictions pertaining to a later instant” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{rosen_anticipatory_1985}</cite>. Poli (2009, 2010), comparing Rosen's and Luhmann's systemic thinking, suggests that anticipatory systems are self-referential, they have a capacity to anticipate their own evolution.</div><div><i>Governance</i> (Greek: Kubernân, Latin: gubernare), supposedly more than 'muddling through' (Lindblom 1959), is piloting, rule-making or steering, referring to the capacity of government to "steer the society”, taking note of the move away from top-down government approach and compartmentalized regulation (Lyall &amp; Tait, 2005) to make and implement policy&nbsp;(Pierre and Peters 2000). In governance, the purpose of foresight is to enhance the ability of decision-makers to engage and shape events at a longer range and, to the best advantage of the citizens they serve <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fuerth_2009}</cite>.</div><div><span>Both anticipation and governance are argued to be necessary, as it is claimed that the  radical character and speed of technological change can shape future societies in unpredictable ways. Futurist Ray Kurzweil has argued that people find the pace of change difficult to grasp, because human nature perceives rates of progress as linear, not exponential&nbsp;</span><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{butler_world_2016}</cite><span>. The significance  of preparation and understanding megatrends, trends, and weak signals </span><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hiltunen_weak_2010}</cite><span> is accentuated as a basis for changing governance strategies  and practice.</span></div><div>In this paper, we explore governance,connected to foresight, used and social change...

For Toffler, anticipatory democracy meant a process of citizen participation coupled with future consciousness, as explained in a subsequent book edited by Clement Bezold&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{bezold_anticipatory_1978}</cite>.&nbsp;Anticipatory&nbsp; governance distinguishes from Alvin Toffler’s notion of anticipatory democracy in,&nbsp;at least three ways: people are able to actively shape technology rather than&nbsp; become shaped by it; forecasting, linear and predictive models are unreliable&nbsp; to be trusted; and rather than experts alone, broader groups of people can&nbsp; self-consciously reflect on the values that go into technology. Guston argues&nbsp; that “by deeply engaging ordinary&nbsp; citizens, integrating knowledge across disciplines, and cultivating a broadly&nbsp; anticipatory disposition, we can lessen the shock of the future.” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{guston_muddled_2016}</cite>. Anticipatory governance is distinctive from&nbsp; adaptive governance <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hurlbert_adaptive_2016}</cite>, deliberative governance <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{dryzek_foundations_2012,hendriks_deliberative_2009}</cite>, and&nbsp; reflexive governance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{vos_reflexive_2006,vos_politics_2011}</cite>.</div><div>Bezold sees this mission as an aspiration –&nbsp; genuine, enlightened participation with foresight (Bezold 2006), as a mission of overcoming populism and traditionalistic political culture. Despite its challenge, the alternative is to practice governance blindly to the longer term implications of&nbsp; decisions (Fuerth 2009). Anticipatory governance, motivated by risk and uncertainty, can bring forward engagement, with a whole-of-government (governance) approach to complex issues, to be cultivated as a systemic culture (Fuerth 2009). In relation to innovation and technology, it emerges from a vision of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) <cite><a href="#von_schomberg_vision_2013">(von Schomberg 2013)</a></cite>.</div><div>Anticipatory  governance has been applied on the one hand, to deal with emerging technologies such as nanotechnology <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008,karinen_toward_2009}</cite>, carbon nanotubes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{philbrick_anticipatory_2010}</cite> or synthetic biology <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{wiek_sustainability_2012}</cite>, and on the other hand, is contextualized through social objectives,  such as urban development.&nbsp;</div><div>In the early 2000s, two strands of literature in anticipatory governance began to emerge: 1) public administration and management, and 2) environmental studies and policy (Karinen and Guston 2010)(Guston 2014).</div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Anticipatory governance of emerging technologies</h1><div>Emerging&nbsp; technologies can create a new industry or transform an existing one.&nbsp;Risk&nbsp;assessments of emerging technologies address social and environmental risk and hazard. Only&nbsp; as the last step, a prospective&nbsp; assessment asks ‘what if’ and ‘how could’ questions (conventionally through&nbsp; forecasting) (Myers 2007).&nbsp; Problematically, many of the effects of a technology, and how innovations and&nbsp; technologies come to shape ‘reality’, are only known afterwards.</div><div>The term anticipatory governance is widely in use in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), particularly with relation to nanotechnology. Guston defines anticipatory governance as a "broad-based capacity extended through society that can act on a variety of inputs to manage emerging knowledge-based technologies while such management is still possible" <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{barben_anticipatory_2008}</cite>&nbsp;(pp. 992-993) use a similar definition: "the ability of a variety of lay and expert stakeholders [...] to collectively imagine, critique, and thereby shape the issues presented by emerging technologies before they become reified in particular ways".</div><div>The terms used in both definitions ("while such management is still possible", "before they become reified") refer to the so-called so-called Collingridge dilemma: first the social consequences of emerging technologies are unclear, and when they become clearer, it is already too late to act on them due to path-dependence and technological lock-in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>. The basic assumption is the one shared in all foresight work, that early anticipatory action is better than reacting later when problems and crises have already emerged. Therefore government agencies and technology developers are increasingly expected to anticipate possible consequences of technology development and to make informed decisions.</div><div>An easy answer would be that the design of an innovation itself should be safe. And indeed, emerging technologies often need safeguards from 'evident' identifiable issues. Off-road vehicles did not have rollover protection, environmentally hazardous lead was widely used in gasoline (Myers 2007), and the first drone accident is seen only as a matter of time, it is 'anticipated'. Another dilemma are 'unforeseen' impacts of emerging technologies, consequences seen only long after technological development.&nbsp;The harms of asbestos, DDT, or plastic waste in oceans today were only realized decades later.&nbsp;Social media transcends place and provides connectedness, but their algorithms also undermine our ability to focus and potentially undermine productivity. Others have pointed out how the humankind has committed an error with locking into fossil&nbsp; fuel technologies, and how correcting this mistake may now be too late, if at&nbsp; all possible - anymore. &nbsp;</div><div>Thirdly, the direction and consequences of scientific discovery and innovation itself are notoriously difficult to foresee. When Albert Einstein developed the Theory of Relativity, this was a remarkable achievement for astronomy and theoretical physics, and subsequent scientific discoveries. Some 40 years later, although not wished by Einstein himself, his ideas led to the invention and eventual use of the atomic bomb in World War II, and nuclear deterrence in the Cold War. (Then again, such developments may also run vice versa. A fusion bomb, for instance, might be considered as an antecedent, if later there is a breakthrough in fusion energy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kuusi_2002}</cite>.</div><div>Despite the opportunities of technological development,</div><div>‘Destructive&nbsp; creation’, used in entrepreneurship literature,&nbsp;refers to innovations that do not have a positive impact on the end&nbsp; user (Baumol 1996; Lucas and Fuller 2017)</div><div>Anticipatory governance aims to build capacities in foresight (open-ended instead of predictive), engagement and integration (of social science and humanities research&nbsp; with emerging technologies)&nbsp;(Guston 2010)<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div>Anticipatory governance emerges from distributed social and epistemological capacities, including collective self-criticism, imagination and learning through trial and error&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008}</cite>.</div><div>Critics have pointed out that the perspective of anticipatory governance may contribute to the hubris of technoscience <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Boenink_2013,Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div>Ethics is connected to anticipatory governance of emerging technologies in two ways. Firstly, the foresight exercises try to uncover possible future ethical and social issues related to the technology in question. Ethics is thus the connected to the substance of the foresight. Secondly, there are many ethical questions related to the foresight methods that are used, such as stakeholder participation and the use of power. This is the methodological or meta-level ethical element.</div><div>In the following sections, we will discuss central theme which we have identified from the literature on anticipatory governance. We have chosen participation as the central theme because it brings together many of the more specific issues related to anticipatory governance of emerging technologies.</div><div>Robert JS&nbsp;Miller CA&nbsp;Milleson V&nbsp;(2013)&nbsp;Introduction: Ethics and anticipatory governance of nano-neurotechnological convergence.

In particular, citizens and civil society actors are expected to participate in the development of emerging technologies from an early stage ('upstream' engagement) <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>. In general terms, actors can be divided into government actors, industry actors and civil society actors. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Wiek_2007}</cite> expand this categorization to include 10 types of actors in the case of nanotechnology: industry, consultants, insurers, investors, public research institutes, government regulatory agencies, government research funding agencies, NGOs and media. In any case, the actor network is complex.</div><div>The three pillars of anticipatory governance (foresight, engagement and integration) were mentioned earlier. This section focuses specifically on the engagement part, raising key themes and issues that were found in the literature search. Engagement is a rising trend in anticipatory governance of emerging technologies, at least on the level of discourse.&nbsp;In recent decades, participation in governance of technologies has evolved from increasing the public's level of knowledge, a one-way educating activity, into engaging the public in a two-way dialogue <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012}</cite><cite><a href="#Flear_2012"></a><a href="#Flear_2012"></a></cite>.</div><div>Involving citizens early in the design process is expected to contribute new perspectives, experiences and dilemmas <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>. One key reason for conducting technology assessment in a participatory and deliberative manner is that non-experts may make sense of technology in unexpected ways <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Selin_2011}</cite>.</div><div>As one example, in research workshops, students or researchers may align their research towards more socially valuable targets&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{karinen_toward_2009}</cite> (Karinen and Guston 2010)</div><div>"as the participatory movement attempts the awkward transition from high theory to complex and messy practice, a number of dilemmas are encountered which problematise the notion of public engagement as a potential solution to the 'wicked' problems of science governance" <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sturgis_2014}</cite></div><div><div><b>Theme: anticipation and deep uncertainty:&nbsp;</b>Of course, the key challenge in anticipatory governance is the 
uncertainty of future consequences. Even though technology experts are 
involved in the process, nobody can claim to know with certainty the 
long-term consequences of developing technology in a particular 
direction. In this context, a distinction is often made between&nbsp;<i>risk,</i> where the probabilities of possible outcomes are known or predictable, and&nbsp;<i>uncertainty</i>, where probabilities are unknown. In anticipatory governance, we are dealing with techno-scientific expectations which are future-oriented abstractions: intentions, goals, hopes and proposals&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lucivero_2011}</cite>.</div><div>To leap from such uncertain expectations to firm This is particularly challenging because such uncertain anticipatory knowledge is intended as justification for making decisions and taking certain actions in the present. How can decision-makers take decisive steps based on uncertain anticipatory knowledge?</div><div>Making claims about future states is problematic from an epistemological point of view. There is a kind of triple uncertainty involved: firstly, we cannot predict future outcomes; secondly, we cannot always know what is a good future; and thirdly, we do not know what actions should be taken to reach this future <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>. These problems were already noted by Malaska, who asked to what extent futures are knowable, to what extent we can shape the course of the future, and to what extent we can choose aims and goals according to our values <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Malaska_2001}</cite>. Outcomes of technologies regarding culture and society are particularly 
uncertain. Societal issues are not simply 'out there' to be found, but 
they co-evolve in the interplay between technology development and its 
use by societal actors <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite> argue that uncertain normative claims must be translated in order to be comprehensible to other stakeholders in discourse, and suggest Habermas' discourse ethics as a framework that can solve the problem of uncertainty in making normative future claims. In practice, they suggest breaking normative claims into constituent parts and questioning the validity of each part in discourse. The underlying notion is similar to the epistemic implication model that Wendell Bell discusses: the evidence base for normative claims should be made explicit and questioned <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{bell1997foundations}</cite>.</div><div><b>Theme: anticipation with relation to articulating and defining problems:</b> problems are defined in the course of inquiry, they don't exist beforehand <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite></div><div></div><div><b>Theme: Means of participation:</b>&nbsp;The means of promoting participation are highly important because badly executed participation may in fact be harmful. For instance, it may produce recommendations that are not representative of the views of the public&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sturgis_2014}</cite>.</div><div>The NanoFutures project created an online discussion forum and a wiki site to test and develop scenarios in an 'open source' manner <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Selin_2011}</cite>.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Wiek_2009}</cite> argue for the use of rigorous scenario methodology for sustainable governance of emerging technologies, claiming that previously scenarios have been based on intuitive expert-based visions.</div><div>The contemporary view of scholars on public engagement in science is that it is necessary for scientists and the public to meet directly in an open and equal exchange of views <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sturgis_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Pitfalls of citizen participation: participation may actually be used as a technique for regulating, co-opting and pacifying publics <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012,barben_anticipatory_2008}</cite>. In this case, open dialogue is only illusory and the hidden agenda is to legitimate a development path that has already been decided. One literature source expresses this agenda rather well: "Participation is a technology to build trust and promote consumption in the marketplace, rather than regulate innovation"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012}</cite>. In addition, social science researchers themselves may be viewed as instruments of governance, raising difficult questions of reflexivity and being part of the social world that is studied&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008}</cite>.</div><div>Challenges regarding means of participation are often connected to pragmatic concerns such as the availability of time and resources for participation. In the economic pressure to ensure efficient use of public participation, certain discourses about technologies are given precedence. &nbsp;As a consequence, contrary and pessimistic voices are easily undermined&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012}</cite>.</div><div></div><div><b>Theme: distribution of roles and responsibilities in the actor network:</b> distribution of roles between technology developers and civil society actors is currently seen in overly simple terms <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite></div><div></div><div>Governance of emerging technologies requires more than risk management by technology experts <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wiek_2007}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Since the actor network is complex, even identifying the current state is difficult. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Wiek_2007}</cite> suggest agent network analysis as an approach to identify agents, functions and roles in governance of emerging technologies.</div><div></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>, arguing that claims about future consequences need to be 'translated' in public discourse, put a great deal of emphasis on the facilitators of this translation: ethicists, scientists, developers and other experts. This communication role is clearly necessary for these experts, but it implies new kinds of communication skills which experts need to learn. Of course, this role gives great power to experts and may lead to conflicts of interest <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>. The translation of claims also implies that members of the public need to trust experts to truthfully translate the claims to language understandable by non-experts. In recent times, this trust in experts has been increasingly questioned.</div><div></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite> both suggest that third parties such as philosophers and social scientists are useful in mediating between technology experts and the broader public.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{barben_anticipatory_2008}</cite> mention science museums, such as the Science Museum of London, as a central intermediary actor.</div><div></div><div>A challenge in the distribution of roles is that participation may place too much burden on citizens, some of whom may be unwilling to participate or unable to clearly articulate their values, opinions and concerns. From a critical point of view, by emphanizing citizens' agency, citizens may made to feel responsible for failures of technologies <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012}</cite>.</div><div></div><div><b>Theme: definition of "relevant stakeholders", and especially "the public":</b></div><div>Participatory and anticipatory governance requires engaging relevant stakeholders, which raises the challenge of separating relevant from irrelevant stakeholders. Who are legitimate sources of futuristic technology visions <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008}</cite>? This is particularly challenging given the broad societal focus of anticipatory governance.</div><div>There is no single 'public' that is already out there to be consulted. Instead, there are multiple publics which &nbsp;organize around a specific issue when broad societal concerns emerge, for instance when technoscientific objectives are seen as treatening&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Jasanoff_2014,Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>. This perspective raises a challenge for anticipatory governance: how deep should public participation be? It is relatively easy to identify relevant NGOs and civil society organizations, but it is more difficult to identify more amorphous publics that emerge around specific concerns. In practical terms, who should be invited to a workshop on a technology that concerns practically everyone?</div><div>Perhaps an even more challenging issue is how 'the public' can be consulted in an anticipatory manner, if issue-oriented publics for future issues have not yet been formed. In theory, the workshop organizer would need to anticipate which individuals and groups may become part of the concerned group regarding a certain technology, but there is clearly a significant risk of mistakes.</div><div><b>Theme: positive benefits / negative risks: </b>Important theme because this defines the knowledge interest in the foresight study.</div><div></div><div><b>Theme: increasing reflexivity in science and innovation:</b> e.g.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008}</cite></div><div></div><div></div><div>Critics have pointed out that the perspective of anticipatory governance may contribute to the hubris of technoscience <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Boenink_2013,Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Ethics is connected to anticipatory governance of emerging technologies in two ways.
