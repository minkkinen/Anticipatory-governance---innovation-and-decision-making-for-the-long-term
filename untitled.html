Despite&nbsp; the opportunities of technological development, emerging technologies have consequences that are seen only long after their development. When Albert Einstein developed the Special Theory&nbsp; of Relativity, this was a remarkable achievement for theoretical physics, and subsequent scientific discoveries. Some 40 years later, although not wished by Einstein himself, his ideas led to the invention and eventual use of the atomic bomb in World War II, and nuclear deterrence. Such developments could also run vice versa. A fusion bomb, for instance, might be considered as an antecedent, should&nbsp;there be later a breakthrough in fusion energy that would provide humankind with 'clean energy'&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kuusi_technological_2002}</cite>.</div><div>As it is claimed that the  radical character and speed of technological change could shape future societies in unpredictable ways&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{butler_world_2016}</cite>, the significance  of preparation and understanding megatrends, trends, and weak signals <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hiltunen_weak_2010}</cite> is accentuated as a basis for changing governance strategies  and practice. Futurist Ray Kurzweil has&nbsp; argued that people find the pace of change difficult to grasp, because human&nbsp; nature perceives rates of progress as linear, not exponential.</div><div>In this paper, we explore governance,connected to foresight, useds and social change...

Guston argues&nbsp; that “by deeply engaging ordinary&nbsp; citizens, integrating knowledge across disciplines, and cultivating a broadly&nbsp; anticipatory disposition, we can lessen the shock of the future.” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{guston_muddled_2016}</cite>.

Guston defines anticipatory governance as a "broad-based capacity extended through society that can act on a variety of inputs to manage emerging knowledge-based technologies while such management is still possible" <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>. The starting point is the so-called Collingridge dilemma: first the social consequences of emerging technologies are unclear, and when they become clearer, it is already too late to act on them due to path-dependence and technological lock-in <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>. The basic assumption is the one shared in all foresight work, that early anticipatory action is better than reacting when problems and crises have already emerged. Therefore government agencies and technology developers are increasingly expected to anticipate possible consequences of technology development and to make informed decisions.</div><div></div><div>Anticipatory governance aims to build capacities in foresight, engagement and integration <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>In the early 2000s, two strands of literature in anticipatory governance began to emerge: 1) public administration and management, and 2) environmental studies and policy <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Critics have pointed out that the perspective of anticipatory governance may contribute to the hubris of technoscience <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Boenink_2013,Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Ethics is connected to anticipatory governance of emerging technologies in two ways.

In particular, citizens and civil society actors are expected to participate in the development of emerging technologies from an early stage ('upstream' engagement) <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>. In general terms, actors can be divided into government actors, industry actors and civil society actors. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Wiek_2007}</cite> expand this categorization to include 10 types of actors in the case of nanotechnology: industry, consultants, insurers, investors, public research institutes, government regulatory agencies, government research funding agencies, NGOs and media. In any case, the actor network is complex.</div><div>Involving citizens early in the design process is expected to contribute new perspectives, experiences and dilemmas <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>. One key reason for conducting technology assessment in a participatory and deliberative manner is that non-experts may make sense of technology in unexpected ways <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Selin_2011}</cite>.</div><div>"as the participatory movement attempts the awkward transition from high theory to complex and messy practice, a number of dilemmas are encountered which problematise the notion of public engagement as a potential solution to the 'wicked' problems of science governance" <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sturgis_2014}</cite></div><div><div><b>Theme: anticipation and deep uncertainty: </b>Of course, the key challenge in anticipatory governance is the 
uncertainty of future consequences. Even though technology experts are 
involved in the process, nobody can claim to know with certainty the 
long-term consequences of developing technology in a particular 
direction. In this context, a distinction is often made between <i>risk,</i> where the probabilities of possible outcomes are known or predictable, and <i>uncertainty</i>, where probabilities are unknown.</div><div>This is particularly challenging because such uncertain anticipatory knowledge is intended as justification for making decisions and taking certain actions in the present. How can decision-makers take decisive steps based on uncertain anticipatory knowledge?</div><div>Making claims about future states is problematic from an epistemological point of view. There is a kind of triple uncertainty involved: firstly, we cannot predict future outcomes; secondly, we cannot always know what is a good future; and thirdly, we do not know what actions should be taken to reach this future <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>. These problems were already noted by Malaska, who asked to what extent futures are knowable, to what extent we can shape the course of the future, and to what extent we can choose aims and goals according to our values <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Malaska_2001}</cite>. Outcomes of technologies regarding culture and society are particularly 
uncertain. Societal issues are not simply 'out there' to be found, but 
they co-evolve in the interplay between technology development and its 
use by societal actors <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite> argue that uncertain normative claims must be translated in order to be comprehensible to other stakeholders in discourse, and suggest Habermas' discourse ethics as a framework that can solve the problem of uncertainty in making normative future claims. In practice, they suggest breaking normative claims into constituent parts and questioning the validity of each part in discourse. The underlying notion is similar to the epistemic implication model that Wendell Bell discusses: the evidence base for normative claims should be made explicit and questioned <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{bell1997foundations}</cite>.</div><div><b>Theme: anticipation with relation to articulating and defining problems:</b> problems are defined in the course of inquiry, they don't exist beforehand <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite></div><div></div><div><b>Theme: Means of participation:</b> the NanoFutures project created an online discussion forum and a wiki site to test and develop scenarios in an 'open source' manner <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Selin_2011}</cite>.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Wiek_2009}</cite> argue for the use of rigorous scenario methodology for sustainable governance of emerging technologies, claiming that previously scenarios have been based on intuitive expert-based visions.</div><div>Necessary for scientists and the public to meet directly in an open and equal exchange of views <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sturgis_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div><div>Pitfalls of citizen participation: participation actually used as a technique for regulating publics <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012}</cite>.</div><div><b>Theme: distribution of roles and responsibilities in the actor network:</b> distribution of roles between technology developers and civil society actors is currently seen in overly simple terms <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite></div><div>Governance of emerging technologies requires more than risk management by technology experts <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wiek_2007}</cite>.</div><div>Since the actor network is complex, even identifying the current state is difficult. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Wiek_2007}</cite> suggest agent network analysis as an approach to identify agents, functions and roles in governance of emerging technologies.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>, arguing that claims about future consequences need to be 'translated' in public discourse, put a great deal of emphasis on the facilitators of this translation: ethicists, scientists, developers and other experts. This communication role is clearly necessary for these experts, but it implies new kinds of communication skills which experts need to learn. Of course, this role gives great power to experts and may lead to conflicts of interest <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>. The translation of claims also implies that members of the public need to trust experts to truthfully translate the claims to language understandable by non-experts. In recent times, this trust in experts has been increasingly questioned.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite> both suggest that third parties such as philosophers and social scientists are useful in mediating between technology experts and the broader public.</div><div>A challenge in the distribution of roles is that participation may place too much burden on citizens, some of whom may be unwilling to participate or unable to clearly articulate their values, opinions and concerns.</div><div><b>Theme: definition of the public:</b> Publics are not already out there to be consulted, but they <i>emerge </i>with relation to a specific issue when broader societal concerns emerge&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>. This perspective raises a challenge for anticipatory governance: how deep should participation be? It is relatively easy to identify relevant NGOs and civil society organizations, but it is more difficult to identify more amorphous publics that emerge around specific concerns. In practical terms, who should be invited to a workshop on a technology that concerns practically everyone?</div><div><b>Theme: positive benefits / negative risks: </b>Important theme because this defines the knowledge interest in the foresight study.</div><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Case of renewable energy technologies</h1><div>Haku: anticipation solar (ScienceDirect)</div><div></div><div>Sean Low Engineering imaginaries: Anticipatory foresight for solar radiation management governance Science of The Total Environment Volume 58015 February 2017 Pages 90-104 ISSN 0048-9697 <a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.200">http://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.200</a>.</div>
