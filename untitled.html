<h1 data-label="886694" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>When Albert Einstein developed the Theory of Relativity, this was a remarkable achievement for astronomy and theoretical physics, and subsequent scientific discoveries. Some 40 years later, although not wished by Einstein himself, his ideas led to the invention and eventual use of the atomic bomb in World War II, and nuclear deterrence in the Cold War. But scientific progress may also run counter-wise: a fusion bomb, for instance, might be considered as an antecedent, if later there is a breakthrough in fusion energy&nbsp;(Kuusi 2002).&nbsp;<span>Futurist Ray Kurzweil argues that people find the pace of change difficult to grasp because human nature perceives rates of progress as linear, not exponential</span>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{butler_world_2016} </cite>.

Next, we explore and define how we understand anticipatory governance. We then explore its significance for emerging technologies, and this is followed by a section on the means of participation. We move to draw connections of the anticipatory governance approach with foresight and scenario literature (taking note of the dedicated course literature).

Phenomenologists such as Edmund Husserl see anticipation as an essential feature of human action. Anticipation may provide faster adaptivity in dynamic environments with internal reflection and planning, enhance the chances of survival, and is also helpful for social interaction (Butz,&nbsp; Sigaud, and Gérard 2003; Poli 2010). Anticipation, as a scholarly approach,&nbsp;owes to theoretical biology and physics where anticipations are understood to contribute to complexity, life and stabilization of chaotic control processes.&nbsp;An anticipatory system is for&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{rosen_anticipatory_1985}</cite> “one in which present change of state depends upon future circumstances, rather than merely on the present or past”. In almost similar vein, Nadin (2012,&nbsp; xxxiv), sees an anticipatory system as “a system whose current state is determined not only by a past state, but also by possible future states”. Poli (2009, 2010) compares Rosen's and Luhmann's systemic thinking, and suggests that anticipatory systems are self-referential i.e. they have a capacity to anticipate their own evolution. Anticipation is closely linked with complexity. To measure life is different from all other forms of measurement; to understand life is to acknowledge complexity (Nadin 2012).&nbsp;Four contemporary approaches to anticipation have been identified: anticipation&nbsp;in&nbsp; biological, psychological and social systems; anticipation and resilience; anticipation and futures literacy; and anticipatory governance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{miller2014discipline}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div><i>Governance&nbsp;</i>(Greek: Kubernân, Latin: gubernare), supposedly more than merely 'muddling through' (Lindblom 1959), is piloting, rule-making or steering, and refers to the capacity of government to "steer the society”. The intellectual core of governance theories derives from administrative studies and political science, typically interested in how policy is formulated, implemented and evaluated&nbsp;(see e.g. Pierre and Peters 2000). In many western countries, planning systems are undergoing theoretical and methodological change, shaped by a 'push' to escape top-down government approach, compartmentalized regulation (Lyall &amp; Tait, 2005), emphasizing planning as a communicative rationality, and exploring the virtues of community-based planning (see Serrao-Neumann et al. 2015).&nbsp;Foresight has been considered as a tool that can enhance the ability of decision-makers to engage and shape events at a longer range and, to the best advantage of the citizens they serve.</div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Anticipatory governance</h1><div>In the early 2000s, two strands of literature in&nbsp;<i>anticipatory governance</i> begin to emerge: one of public administration and management, and a second of &nbsp;environmental studies and policy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Karinen_2009,Guston_2014}</cite>. The intellectual ancestor of&nbsp;anticipatory governance is Alvin Toffler's notion of 'anticipatory democracy' in the 1970s, a prescription against a “future shock”. For Toffler, anticipatory democracy meant a process of citizen participation coupled with future consciousness&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{bezold_anticipatory_1978} </cite>. Thirty years later, when Bezold revisited the notion of anticipatory democracy; he described it  as an aspiration of genuine, enlightened participation with foresight (Bezold 2006) –&nbsp;a mission of overcoming populism and traditionalistic political culture.</div><div>Anticipatory&nbsp; governance distinguishes from Toffler’s notion of anticipatory democracy in,&nbsp;at least three ways: people are able to actively shape technology rather than become shaped by it; forecasting, linear and predictive models are (too) unreliable to be trusted; and rather than experts alone, broader groups of people can self-consciously reflect on the values that go into technology. Guston argues that “by deeply engaging ordinary citizens, integrating knowledge across disciplines, and cultivating a broadly anticipatory disposition, we can lessen the shock of the future.”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{guston_muddled_2016} </cite>. Anticipatory governance, motivated by risk and uncertainty, can bring forward engagement, with a whole-of-government (governance) approach to complex issues, to be cultivated as a systemic culture (Fuerth 2009).&nbsp;It relates closely to a  vision of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). This way, anticipatory governance as part of responsible innovation may drive innovation towards 'societal desirable ends'<cite>&nbsp;<a href="#von_schomberg_vision_2013">(von Schomberg 2013)&nbsp;</a></cite>. In addition to providing strategic vision, anticipatory&nbsp; governance can be used as an evaluative tool (Foley et al. 2015). Anticipatory governance is distinctive from adaptive governance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hurlbert_adaptive_2016} </cite>, deliberative governance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{dryzek_foundations_2012,hendriks_deliberative_2009} </cite>, and reflexive governance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{vos_reflexive_2006,vos_politics_2011} </cite>.</div><div>Anticipatory governance is widely in use in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS).&nbsp;Anticipatory governance, in the context of emerging technologies, means the ways in which research, development, application and use of a technology are developed and steered<cite>&nbsp;<a href="#Read_2015">(Read 2015)&nbsp;</a></cite>, between adapting to a coming revolution and halting  development&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008} </cite>. Products of science and technology do not appear magically, they appear in the hands of people (Sarewitz 2011) and&nbsp;through technoscientific imaginaries (Wiek and Guston 2012). They may or are expected to create new industries, transform existing ones - and shape societies. But not all innovations have a&nbsp;positive impact on life on earth.&nbsp;Borrowing from entrepreneurship literature, there is also ‘destructive creation’ (Baumol 1996; Lucas and Fuller 2017).&nbsp;Prohibiting innovation altogether may not  be desirable (Sarewitz 2011), but responsible, adaptive and integrated&nbsp; management of the innovation process should have ‘ethics' as a design principle.</div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Anticipatory governance of emerging technologies</h1><div>Anticipatory governance of emerging technologies, in this sense, is a particular approach of technology governance which can be differentiated from reactive governance. Anticipatory&nbsp; governance has  been applied to anticipate the emergence of nanotechnology&nbsp;(Barben 2008, Karinen 2009), and more recently, to deal with other emerging technologies such as carbon nanotubes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{philbrick_anticipatory_2010}</cite>, geoengineering (Foley et al. 2015), synthetic biology&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{wiek_sustainability_2012}</cite>, and solar radiation management&nbsp;(Low 2017).  Guston defines anticipatory governance as a "broad-based capacity extended through society that can act on a variety of inputs to manage emerging knowledge-based technologies while such management is still possible"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014} </cite>.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{barben_anticipatory_2008} </cite>&nbsp;(pp. 992-993) use a similar definition: "the ability of a variety of lay and expert stakeholders [...] to collectively imagine, critique, and thereby shape the issues presented by emerging technologies before they become reified in particular ways".</div><div>The terms used in both definitions ("while such management is still possible", "before they become reified") refer to the so-called so-called Collingridge dilemma: first the social consequences of emerging technologies are unclear, and when they become clearer, it is already too late to act on them due to path-dependence and technological lock-in <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a} </cite>. The basic assumption is the one shared in all foresight work, that early anticipatory action is better than reacting later when problems and crises have already emerged. Therefore government agencies and technology developers are increasingly expected to anticipate possible consequences of technology development and to make informed decisions.</div><div>An easy answer to the anticipatory dilemma would be that the design of an innovation itself should be safe. And indeed, emerging technologies often need safeguards from 'evident' identifiable issues. Off-road vehicles lacked  rollover protection and environmentally hazardous lead was widely used in gasoline&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{myers_anticipation_2007}</cite>. Now,  the first drone accidents are&nbsp;seen only as a matter of time, they are 'anticipated'. Another dilemma are 'unforeseen' impacts of emerging technologies, consequences experienced only long after technological development.&nbsp;The harms of asbestos, DDT, or plastic waste in oceans  were only realized decades later.&nbsp;Social media algorithms also undermine  ability to focus. Diverging from our 'lock-in' to fossil fuel technologies may now be too late, if at all possible - anymore.</div><div>Anticipatory governance has also been used by the likes of Serrao-Neumann&nbsp; et al. (2013) who look at land-use planning and what adaptive strategies are needed to tackle climate change.</div><div>Anticipatory governance aims to build capacities in foresight (open-ended instead of predictive), engagement and integration (of social science and humanities research&nbsp; with emerging technologies)&nbsp;(Guston 2010) <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014} </cite>.</div><div>Anticipatory governance emerges from distributed social and epistemological capacities, including collective self-criticism, imagination and learning through trial and error <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008} </cite>.</div><div>For instance, critics have pointed out that the perspective of anticipatory governance may contribute to the hubris of technoscience <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Boenink_2013,Guston_2014} </cite>.&nbsp;Another challenge of anticipatory  governance is that new science/knowledge is constantly produced.</div><div>In the following sections, we will discuss central themes which we have identified from the literature on anticipatory governance. We have chosen participation as the overarching theme because it brings together many of the more specific issues related to anticipatory governance of emerging technologies.</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Participation in governance of emerging technologies</h2><div>Participation is a key theme in anticipatory governance of emerging technologies. Some level of participation is implicit already in the governance concept, and the future orientation adds another layer of participation, as foresight is usually envisioned as a participatory process. Governance of emerging technologies is an increasingly multi-actor exercise. In particular, citizens and civil society actors are expected to participate in the development of emerging technologies from an early stage ('upstream' engagement) <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015} </cite>. In general terms, actors can be divided into government actors, industry actors and civil society actors. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Wiek_2007} </cite> expand this categorization to include 10 types of actors in the case of nanotechnology: industry, consultants, insurers, investors, public research institutes, government regulatory agencies, government research funding agencies, NGOs and media. In any case, the actor network is complex.</div><div>The three pillars of anticipatory governance (foresight, engagement and integration) were mentioned earlier. This section focuses specifically on the engagement part, raising key themes and issues that were found in the literature search. Engagement is a rising trend in anticipatory governance of emerging technologies, at least on the level of discourse.&nbsp;In recent decades, participation in governance of technologies has evolved from increasing the public's level of knowledge, a one-way educating activity, into engaging the public in a two-way dialogue <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012} </cite>. In a discussion of styles of governance, <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Read_2015} </cite>&nbsp;unite 'anticipatory' and 'open' into the same style of governance, meaning broad stakeholder participation and identifying emerging risks and opportunities. The other style of governance is formal, reactive and closed. Involving citizens early in the design process is expected to contribute new perspectives, experiences and dilemmas <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015} </cite>. One key reason for conducting technology assessment in a participatory and deliberative manner is that non-experts may make sense of technology in unexpected ways <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Selin_2011} </cite>.</div><div>As one example, in research workshops, students or researchers may align their research towards more socially valuable targets <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{karinen_toward_2009} </cite> (Karinen and Guston 2010)</div><div>However, participation is not a simple solution and as is common with wicked problems, the solutions may raise new ethical issues. As <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Sturgis_2014} </cite> puts it, "as the participatory movement attempts the awkward transition from high theory to complex and messy practice, a number of dilemmas are encountered which problematise the notion of public engagement as a potential solution to the 'wicked' problems of science governance". On the general level, participatory governance of emerging technologies is 'ethical' in two senses. Firstly, the foresight exercises try to uncover possible future ethical and social issues related to the technology&nbsp;in question. Secondly, there are ethical questions related to the participatory methods that are used, such as unequal distribution of power. There are even arguments for challenging the exercise of anticipatory governance.&nbsp;For instance, critics have pointed out that the perspective of anticipatory governance may contribute to the hubris of technoscience (Boenink 2013, Guston 2014).</div><div></div><h3 data-label="970623" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Deep uncertainty and decision-making</h3><div><div>The central challenge in anticipatory governance is the 
uncertainty of future consequences. If outcomes were easily and accurately calculable in advance, foresight would be a kind of optimization exercise where the best course of action could be decided relatively easily. However, this is not the case. Even though technology experts are 
involved in the process, nobody can claim to know with certainty the 
long-term consequences of developing technology in a particular 
    direction. In this context, a distinction is often made between&nbsp;<i>risk,&nbsp;</i> where the probabilities of possible outcomes are known or predictable, and&nbsp;<i>uncertainty&nbsp;</i>, where probabilities are unknown. In anticipatory governance, we are dealing with techno-scientific expectations which are future-oriented abstractions: intentions, goals, hopes and proposals&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lucivero_2011} </cite>. To leap from such uncertain expectations to firm judgments and policy decisions is problematic. How can decision-makers take decisive steps based on uncertain anticipatory knowledge?</div><div>Making claims about future states is problematic from an epistemological point of view, as futures researchers have acknowledged for decades. There is a kind of triple uncertainty involved: firstly, we cannot predict future outcomes; secondly, we cannot always know what is a good future; and thirdly, we do not know what actions should be taken to reach this future <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a} </cite>. These problems were already noted by Malaska, who asked to what extent futures are knowable, to what extent we can shape the course of the future, and to what extent we can choose aims and goals according to our values <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Malaska_2001} </cite>. Outcomes of technologies regarding culture and society are particularly 
uncertain. Potential societal issues are not simply 'out there' to be found, but 
they co-evolve in the interplay between technology development and its 
    use by societal actors <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015} </cite>. To some extent, futurists themselves are creating and promoting social issues by articulating them, that is, 'speaking them into existence'.</div><div>Even though there is radical uncertainty regarding future outcomes, some steps can be taken to at least clarify currently existing future claims of those participating in future discourse.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Mittelstadt_2015a} </cite> argue that uncertain normative claims must be translated in order to be comprehensible to other stakeholders in discourse, and suggest Habermas' discourse ethics as a framework that can solve the problem of uncertainty in making normative future claims. In practice, they suggest breaking normative claims into constituent parts and questioning the validity of each part in discourse. The underlying notion is similar to the epistemic implication model that Wendell Bell discusses: the evidence base for normative claims should be made explicit and questioned&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{bell1997foundations} </cite>.</div><div>In a similar manner, <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Lucivero_2011} </cite> argue that statements about expectations can be broken down into three types of claims: about characteristics and functioning of technology, about how technology will be adopted and integrated into practice, and about how technology will address a social problem or need. The implication is that discussion on societal aspects of technology need to assess not only technical feasibility but also usability and desirability of expected technologies. The third aspect is perhaps the most challenging, because morality evolves over time and the public perception of future technologies is difficult to assess beforehand. Nevertheless, there are suggestions that future ethical controversies can be systematically explored <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lucivero_2011} </cite>.</div><div></div></div><h3 data-label="783452" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"><div>Means of participation</div></h3><div><div>Another central question is the 'how' question of participation. The means of promoting participation are highly important because badly executed participation may in fact be harmful. For instance, it may produce recommendations that are not representative of the views of the public&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sturgis_2014} </cite>. On the other hand, citizen participation may actually be used as a technique for regulating, co-opting and pacifying publics&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008,Flear_2012} </cite>. In this case, open dialogue is only illusory and the hidden agenda is to legitimate a development path that has already been decided. One literature source expresses this agenda rather well: "Participation is a technology to build trust and promote consumption in the marketplace, rather than regulate innovation"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012} </cite>. In addition, social science researchers themselves may be viewed as instruments of governance, raising difficult questions of reflexivity and being part of the social world that is studied&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008} </cite>. The contemporary view of scholars on public engagement in science is that it is necessary for scientists and the public to meet as directly as possible in an open and equal exchange of views, which is of course easier said than done&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sturgis_2014} </cite>. Challenges regarding means of participation may arise not only from hidden agendas but also pragmatic concerns such as the availability of time and resources for participation. Under economic pressure to ensure efficient use of public participation, certain discourses about technologies are given precedence.&nbsp;As a consequence, contrary and pessimistic voices are easily undermined and seen as counterproductive&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012} </cite>.</div><div></div></div><h3 data-label="987434" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Identifying "relevant stakeholders"</h3><div><div>Participatory and anticipatory governance requires engaging relevant stakeholders, which raises the challenge of separating relevant from irrelevant stakeholders. Who are legitimate sources of futuristic technology visions&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008}</cite>? Making these distinctions is  challenging given the broad societal focus of anticipatory governance. The concept of 'the public' is particularly problematic. There is no single 'public' that is already out there to be consulted. Instead, there are multiple publics which &nbsp;organize around a specific issue when broad societal concerns emerge, for instance when technoscientific objectives are seen as threatening&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Jasanoff_2014,Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>. This perspective raises a challenge for anticipatory governance: how deep should public participation be? It is relatively easy to identify relevant NGOs and civil society organizations, but it is more difficult to identify more amorphous publics that emerge around specific concerns. In practical terms, who should be invited to a workshop on a technology that potentially concerns everyone including future generations? An added challenge is how this public can be consulted in an anticipatory manner, if the issues have not yet fully emerged and thus issue-oriented publics have not yet been formed. In theory, the workshop organizer would need to anticipate which individuals and groups may become part of the concerned group regarding a certain technology, but there is clearly a significant risk of mistakes.</div><div></div></div><h3 data-label="993427" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Assigning roles and responsibilities in the actor network</h3><div><div>A question that is closely related to identifying stakeholders is the distribution of roles and responsibilities in the complex actor network. According to some authors, the distribution of roles between technology developers and civil society actors is currently seen in overly simple terms. Civil society actors are expected to recognize societal concerns which have in fact not yet emerged, and technology developers are expected to know factual future outcomes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>. Nonetheless, the contemporary view is that governance of emerging technologies requires more than 'technocratic' risk management by technology experts <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wiek_2007} </cite>.</div><div>The actor network, like technologies and issues, is continuously evolving. Even identifying the current state of the actor network is difficult, let alone projecting future actor networks.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Wiek_2007} </cite> suggest agent network analysis as an approach to identify agents, functions and roles in governance of emerging technologies.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Mittelstadt_2015a} </cite>, who argue that claims about future consequences need to be 'translated' in public discourse, put a great deal of emphasis on the facilitators of this translation: ethicists, scientists, developers and other experts. This communication role is clearly necessary for these experts, but it implies new kinds of communication skills which experts need to learn. Of course, this role gives great power to experts and may lead to conflicts of interest&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a} </cite>. The translation of claims also implies that members of the public need to trust experts to truthfully translate the claims to language understandable by non-experts. In recent times, this trust in experts has been increasingly questioned.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Lucivero_2011} </cite> write about the&nbsp;<i>situatedness&nbsp;</i>of judgments relating to futures. An expert may be in a good position to judge claims on technological feasibility, but a lay audience is better equipped to examine societal plausibility and desirability.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Papilloud_2014}</cite>&nbsp;similarly divides the anticipatory governance issue into&nbsp;<i>safety&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>desirability&nbsp;</i>components in such a manner that scientists and industry are responsible for safety, which is innovation and product-oriented, and political authorities and civil society, in turn, are responsible for desirability, which is usage-oriented.</div><div>The question of mediating between (hard) science and society is a recurring theme in the literature. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Krabbenborg_2015} </cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Mittelstadt_2015a} </cite> both suggest that third parties such as philosophers and social scientists are useful in mediating between technology experts and the broader public. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Lucivero_2011} </cite> argue that ethicists can play a mediating role by broadening discussions both horizontally, by including different sources of information and stakeholders, and vertically, by feeding the discussions with historical knowledge. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{barben_anticipatory_2008} </cite> mention science museums, such as the Science Museum of London, as a central intermediary actor. The idea seems to be that these third parties can be somewhat more objective in balancing different interest groups and assessing future claims.</div><div>The question of roles in the anticipatory governance network is closely connected to the schools of thought identified by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Tapio_2002} </cite>. We are unaware of any systematic comparisons between anticipatory governance approaches and schools of thought in futures research. However, it seems that contemporary anticipatory governance approaches are placed in the schools of "pluralistic humanism", "polling democracy" and "critical pragmatism", depending on the level of participation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Tapio_2002} </cite>. The role of professionals is strong, and knowledge of possible futures is seen as relatively objective and certainly not purely relativistically.</div><div>A challenge in the distribution of roles is that participation may place too much burden on citizens, some of whom may be unwilling to participate or unable to clearly articulate their values, opinions and concerns.

We now turn to scenario methods, which are a prominent theme in the anticipatory governance literature. Scenarios are central to anticipatory governance because they relate to both the foresight and engagement aspects.</div><div>Roughly two kinds of scenario approaches are promoted in the anticipatory governance literature. Some scenario studies emphasize systematic and formalized foresight methods, others focus more on engagement and participation. In other words, some scenario processes are designed to rely more on formal methods and desk research, while others utilize more intuitive methods and participation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van_Notten_2003} </cite>.&nbsp;<cite>&nbsp;<a href="#Wiek_2009" target="_blank">Wiek et al. (2009)&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</cite>argue for the use of rigorous scenario methodology for sustainable governance of emerging technologies, claiming that previously scenarios have been based on intuitive expert-based visions. A rigorous approach, for them, means a formalized analysis including a software-assisted cluster analysis and consistency analysis.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Cummings_2017} </cite> develop an approach to evaluate synthetic biology risks using scenarios, policy Delphi and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), a formal decision analysis method.</div><div>On the 'engagement' side, the NanoFutures project created an online discussion forum and a wiki site to test and develop scenarios in an 'open source' manner&nbsp;<cite>&nbsp;<a href="#Selin_2011">(Selin 2011)&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</cite>.

According to&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Godet_2000} </cite>, the rational and heuristic scenario planning schools are actually complementary, that is, they mutually support one another. The general point is that scenarios do not need to be constrained by forecasting; they can also account for non-linear developments and sudden, unexpected events. From a scenario planning perspective, the challenge in anticipatory governance scenarios is that the actor network is complex and there is no single focal actor whose strategy is considered. The 'focal issue' is often also a broad problem area rather than a single key decision such as whether to invest or not to invest.</div><div>One interesting use of scenarios is on the meta-level, to investigate the futures of technology governance itself, as in one study of nanotechnology governance <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Read_2015} </cite>. In this case, the scenarios were formed with the standard scenario axes approach, using focal questions and critical uncertainties (style of governance, scope of governance, perception of public perception).</div><div>As one irony, <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{barben_anticipatory_2008} </cite> point out that concentrating on future scenarios rather than on current practices can signify a trade-off in investing resources in “transformative" research at the expense of addressing current ills, as&nbsp;an ethical burden.</div><h1 class="ltx_title_section" data-label="239037">Conclusion</h1><div>Anticipation seems to share joint epistemological and normative premises with futures studies: when thinking of an anticipatory system, this seems to imply an aim where not individual agents only, but communities or societies more broadly (=societal systems), are 'futures conscious'. This is, perhaps, roughly what Poli (2009) means, when he suggests that&nbsp;anticipatory systems could have a capacity to even anticipate their own evolution. Anticipatory governance, which we have discussed more in detail, we can then derive, may be defined by two levels. In its inner core, perhaps less addressed in the literature, is an&nbsp;'idea' or an ideal of how innovations 'should be'. Such ideals are sought, in more&nbsp;practical terms,&nbsp;with anticipatory governance. &nbsp;In both senses, anticipatory governance relates to desirability and the notion of&nbsp; preferred futures (Henchey&nbsp; 1978; Amara 1981).</div><div>Anticipatory governance explores innovation processes (or scientific discovery) by reflecting them with societal expectations, ideally in light of the (even unexpected) implications that may emerge from the uptake of emerging technologies. There is a limitation in conventional risk&nbsp;assessments of emerging technologies when they only address social and environmental risk and hazard. A <span>prospective assessment should ask ‘what if’ and ‘how could’ questions (and move beyond forecasting) <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{myers_anticipation_2007}</cite>. Problematically, many of the effects of a technology, and how innovations and&nbsp; technologies come to shape ‘reality’, are only known afterwards.</span></div><div>The basic issue regarding anticipatory governance of emerging technologies is how to facilitate discourse around complex issues between different actors: technology developers, researchers, governments, civil society actors and citizens. There seems to be consensus that broad stakeholder participation is needed, but the practical implementation of this participation faces many difficult challenges, including identifying possible future ethical problems, engaging the public in an appropriate manner and balancing contradictory knowledge claims about the future.</div><div>The challenges of anticipatory governance of technologies largely stem from the uncertainty that is inherent in the exercise. Future outcomes of scientific developments are uncertain, the issues that may emerge are unclear, it is unclear how to define the 'public' that should be consulted, and so on. The appeal to Habermasian discourse ethics <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>&nbsp;is promising, but what if after informed and honest discussion, we simply cannot agree on the possible future, the good future, necessary actions or all three?</div><div>As the motivation is about governing, anticipatory governance lacks a certain ‘creative’ <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Yunus_2015}</cite>&nbsp;feel, inherent with the process of innovation and discovery, but perhaps also because it does not seem to always explicitly address complexity. As a further possible shortcoming, anticipatory governance seems to have addressed mainly the emergence of individual technologies (or groups of technologies) and engaged less with potential convergences of emerging technologies (see e.g.&nbsp; Glenn et al. 2015, Song et al. 2017) and broader (even speculative) paradigm shifts. Anticipatory governance could also be adapted to address more explicitly socio-ecological resilience. In this task, anticipation should escape narrow&nbsp; definitions, draw from futures studies (Boyd et al. 2015) to think how innovation can become transformation to address sustainability goals (Wiek 2012). I <span>n spite of tackling risk and uncertainty, </span>anticipatory governance literature only sporadically mentions sustainability <span>. &nbsp;It seems that there are signs of&nbsp;anticipation and innovation both moving towards the with aspirations of transformativeness and sustainability (Wiek and Guston 2012; Schot and&nbsp;Steinmüller 2016; Wiek and Lang 2016).</span></div><div>One significant issue is the role that futures research could play in enabling anticipatory governance. The futures field is rarely mentioned in articles on these topics, even though the challenges, such as tackling complexity and uncertainty and ensuring fair and productive workshop practices, are similar in futures research and anticipatory governance. Could futures research play the kind of 'third party' role which authors have suggested as necessary <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015,Mittelstadt_2015a} </cite>?</div><div>Anticipatory governance is related to the grand challenges of our times, since technology plays an increasingly dominant role in our lives and in solving both large and small problems. For <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet*{Krabbenborg_2015} </cite>, creating better public engagement in technology development means nothing less than shaping our society in a more reflexive manner. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Flear_2012} </cite> argue that norms and values promoting a truly democratic European Union and a public consisting of reflexive agents need to be designed into the processes of participation.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="933637" class="ltx_title_section">Appendix: Statement describing the work division</h1><div>The division of work was roughly as follows.</div><div>Joni&nbsp;Karjalainen wrote the Introduction and the following section on the definition of 'anticipatory governance' (origins of the concept, distinguishing anticipatory governance from other fields).&nbsp;</div><div>Section 4 on&nbsp;anticipatory governance of emerging technologies was written jointly.</div><div>Matti Minkkinen wrote the Sections on the themes of participation in governance of emerging technologies.</div><div>The conclusions were drawn together.</div><div></div><div>Joni Karjalainen, Brighton</div><div>Matti Minkkinen, Turku</div><div>7 June 2017</div><div></div><div><b>Add in the end to references via Zotero:</b></div><div>+ see what sources are missing</div><div>Amara, Roy (1981).
