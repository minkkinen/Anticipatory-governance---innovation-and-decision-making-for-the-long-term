<h1 data-label="886694" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div><i>Anticipation&nbsp;</i>refers to anticipatory behaviour, as a process (or behaviour) that not only depends on past and present but also on predictions, expectations, or beliefs about the future, through cognitive or psychological mechanisms of looking ahead and acting accordingly. Phenomenologists such as Edmund Husserl see anticipation as an essential feature of human action. Anticipation may provide faster adaptivity in dynamic environments with internal reflection and planning, enhance the chances of survival, and is also helpful for social interaction (Butz,&nbsp; Sigaud, and Gérard 2003; Poli 2010). Anticipation, as a scholarly approach, owes to theoretical biology and physics where anticipations are understood to contribute to complexity, life and to stabilize chaotic control processes.&nbsp;<i>An anticipatory system</i>&nbsp;for Rosen (1985/2012) is “one in which present change of state depends upon future&nbsp; circumstances, rather than merely on the present or past”. In almost similar vein, Nadin (2012,&nbsp; xxxiv), sees an anticipatory system as “a system whose current state is determined not only by a past state, but also by possible future states”. Poli (2009, 2010) compares Rosen's and Luhmann's systemic thinking, suggests that anticipatory systems are self-referential, they have a capacity to anticipate their own evolution. For Rosen, anticipation is&nbsp; closely linked with complexity. To measure life is different from all other&nbsp; forms of measurement; to understand life is to acknowledge complexity (Nadin&nbsp; 2012).&nbsp;This seemingly relates anticipatory systems and organisational learning. Miller, Poli and Rossel (2013) identify four contemporary approaches to anticipation: anticipation&nbsp;in&nbsp; biological, psychological and social systems; anticipation and resilience; anticipation and futures literacy; and anticipatory governance.&nbsp;</div><div><i>Governance</i> (Greek: Kubernân, Latin: gubernare), supposedly more than merely 'muddling through' (Lindblom 1959), is piloting, rule-making or steering, referring to the capacity of government to "steer the society”. The intellectual core of governance theories derives from administrative studies and political science of making and implementing policy&nbsp;(Pierre and Peters 2000). In many western countries, planning systems are&nbsp; undergoing theoretical and methodological change,&nbsp;shaped by a 'push' to escape top-down government approach, compartmentalized regulation (Lyall &amp; Tait, 2005), &nbsp;taking note of planning as a communicative rationality and community-based planning (see Serrao-Neumann et al. 2015).&nbsp;T<span>he purpose of foresight, in governance,&nbsp;is to enhance the ability of decision-makers to engage and shape events at a longer range and, to the best advantage of the citizens they serve. Such endeavour is challenged by the short-term imperative of policy and politics. Despite its challenge, the alternative is to practice governance blindly to the longer term implications of&nbsp; decisions&nbsp;</span><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fuerth_2009}</cite><span>.&nbsp;Both anticipation and governance are argued to be necessary, as it is claimed that the  radical character and speed of technological change can shape future societies in unpredictable ways. Futurist Ray Kurzweil has argued that people find the pace of change difficult to grasp, because human nature perceives rates of progress as linear, not exponential&nbsp;</span><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{butler_world_2016}</cite><span>. The significance  of preparation and understanding megatrends, trends, and weak signals </span><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hiltunen_weak_2010}</cite><span> is accentuated as a basis for changing governance strategies  and practice.&nbsp;</span></div><div>In this paper, our aim is to shed light on the emerging concept of 'anticipatory governance' (the division of work is elaborated in Appendix 1). We have begun with an introduction of the origins of anticipation and governance. Next, we move to explore and define anticipatory governance. We then explore its significance for emerging technologies, followed by a section on the means of participation. Furthermore, we move to draw connections of the anticipatory governance approach with foresight and scenario literature (taking note of the dedicated course literature). To conclude, we discuss how anticipatory governance, currently promoted by the likes of Riel Miller and Roberto Poli,&nbsp;relates with futures studies more broadly.&nbsp;As a method, our work is based on a literature review through databases (ScienceDirect, Scopus, Google Scholar).</div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Anticipatory governance</h1><div>In the early 2000s, two strands of literature in&nbsp;<i>anticipatory governance</i> had began to emerge: one of public administration and management, and a second of &nbsp;environmental studies and policy (Karinen and Guston 2010)(Guston 2014). The intellectual ancestor of&nbsp;anticipatory governance is Alvin Toffler's notion of 'anticipatory democracy' in the 1970s, a prescription against a “future shock”. For Toffler, anticipatory democracy meant a process of citizen participation coupled with future consciousness, as explained in a book he edited&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{bezold_anticipatory_1978}</cite>. 30 years later,&nbsp;Bezold revisits anticipatory democracy; it is seen as an aspiration of genuine, enlightened participation with foresight (Bezold 2006) –&nbsp;a mission of overcoming populism and traditionalistic political culture.&nbsp;</div><div>Anticipatory&nbsp; governance distinguishes from Alvin Toffler’s notion of anticipatory democracy in,&nbsp;at least three ways: people are able to actively shape technology rather than become shaped by it; forecasting, linear and predictive models are too unreliable to be trusted; and rather than experts alone, broader groups of people can self-consciously reflect on the values that go into technology. Guston argues that “by deeply engaging ordinary citizens, integrating knowledge across disciplines, and cultivating a broadly anticipatory disposition, we can lessen the shock of the future.”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{guston_muddled_2016}</cite>. Anticipatory governance is distinctive from adaptive governance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hurlbert_adaptive_2016}</cite>, deliberative governance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{dryzek_foundations_2012,hendriks_deliberative_2009}</cite>, and reflexive governance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{vos_reflexive_2006,vos_politics_2011}</cite>. Anticipatory governance, in the context of emerging technologies, means the ways in which research, development, application and use of a technology are developed and steered <cite><a href="#Read_2015">(Read 2015)</a></cite>, between adapting to a coming revolution and halting  development (Barben et al. 2008).</div><div>Products of science and technology do not appear magically, they appear in the hands of people (Sarewitz 2011). Future technologies emerge through technoscientific imaginaries (Wiek and Guston 2012).&nbsp;These emerging&nbsp; technologies can create a new industry or transform an existing one.&nbsp;While controlling the direction of innovation may not&nbsp; even be desirable (Sarewitz 2011), responsible, adaptive and integrated&nbsp; management of the innovation process has ‘ethics' as a design principle.&nbsp;Anticipatory governance, motivated by risk and uncertainty, can bring forward engagement, with a whole-of-government (governance) approach to complex issues, to be cultivated as a systemic culture (Fuerth 2009). In relation to innovation and technology, it emerges from a vision of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). This way, anticipatory governance as part of responsible innovation may drive innovation towards 'societal desirable ends'&nbsp;<cite><a href="#von_schomberg_vision_2013">(von Schomberg 2013)</a></cite>. Worryingly, in such efforts, sustainability has often been vaguely defined, and anticipatory governance could benefit from being combined with transformational  sustainability science (Wiek and Guston 2012).&nbsp;In addition to providing strategic vision, anticipatory&nbsp; governance can be used as an evaluative tool (Foley et al. 2015).</div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Anticipatory governance of emerging technologies</h1><div>Anticipatory governance of emerging technologies is a particular approach of technology governance which can be differentiated from reactive governance. Guston defines anticipatory governance as a "broad-based capacity extended through society that can act on a variety of inputs to manage emerging knowledge-based technologies while such management is still possible"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{barben_anticipatory_2008}</cite>&nbsp;(pp. 992-993) use a similar definition: "the ability of a variety of lay and expert stakeholders [...] to collectively imagine, critique, and thereby shape the issues presented by emerging technologies before they become reified in particular ways". What then are these procedural principles  (Wiek and Guston 2012)&nbsp;to collectively influence the&nbsp; development of emerging technologies?</div><div>The terms used in both definitions ("while such management is still possible", "before they become reified") refer to the so-called so-called Collingridge dilemma: first the social consequences of emerging technologies are unclear, and when they become clearer, it is already too late to act on them due to path-dependence and technological lock-in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>. The basic assumption is the one shared in all foresight work, that early anticipatory action is better than reacting later when problems and crises have already emerged. Therefore government agencies and technology developers are increasingly expected to anticipate possible consequences of technology development and to make informed decisions.</div><div>An easy answer would be that the design of an innovation itself should be safe. And indeed, emerging technologies often need safeguards from 'evident' identifiable issues. Off-road vehicles did not have rollover protection, environmentally hazardous lead was widely used in gasoline (Myers 2007), and the first drone accident is seen only as a matter of time, it is 'anticipated'. Another dilemma are 'unforeseen' impacts of emerging technologies, consequences seen only long after technological development.&nbsp;The harms of asbestos, DDT, or plastic waste in oceans today were only realized decades later.&nbsp;Social media transcends place and provides connectedness, but their algorithms also undermine our ability to focus and potentially undermine productivity. Others have pointed out how the humankind has committed an error with locking into fossil&nbsp; fuel technologies, and how correcting this mistake may now be too late, if at&nbsp; all possible - anymore. &nbsp;</div><div>Thirdly, the direction and consequences of scientific discovery and innovation itself are notoriously difficult to foresee. When Albert Einstein developed the Theory of Relativity, this was a remarkable achievement for astronomy and theoretical physics, and subsequent scientific discoveries. Some 40 years later, although not wished by Einstein himself, his ideas led to the invention and eventual use of the atomic bomb in World War II, and nuclear deterrence in the Cold War. (Then again, such developments may also run vice versa. A fusion bomb, for instance, might be considered as an antecedent, if later there is a breakthrough in fusion energy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kuusi_2002}</cite>.</div><div>Papers like Serrao-Neumann  et al. (2013) look at land-use planning and what adaptive strategies are needed  to tackle climate change, but do not explicitly address about the issue of  complexity.</div><div></div><div>Despite the opportunities of technological development,</div><div>‘Destructive&nbsp; creation’, used in entrepreneurship literature,&nbsp;refers to innovations that do not have a positive impact on the end&nbsp; user (Baumol 1996; Lucas and Fuller 2017)</div><div>Anticipatory governance aims to build capacities in foresight (open-ended instead of predictive), engagement and integration (of social science and humanities research&nbsp; with emerging technologies)&nbsp;(Guston 2010)<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div>Anticipatory governance emerges from distributed social and epistemological capacities, including collective self-criticism, imagination and learning through trial and error&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008}</cite>.</div><div>Critics have pointed out that the perspective of anticipatory governance may contribute to the hubris of technoscience <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Boenink_2013,Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div>Ethics is connected to anticipatory governance of emerging technologies in two ways. Firstly, the foresight exercises try to uncover possible future ethical and social issues related to the technology in question. Ethics is thus the connected to the substance of the foresight. Secondly, there are many ethical questions related to the foresight methods that are used, such as stakeholder participation and the use of power. This is the methodological or meta-level ethical element.</div><div>In the following sections, we will discuss central theme which we have identified from the literature on anticipatory governance. We have chosen participation as the central theme because it brings together many of the more specific issues related to anticipatory governance of emerging technologies.</div><div>The term anticipatory governance is widely in use in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), particularly with relation to nanotechnology&nbsp;(Barben 2008, Karinen 2009).&nbsp;Anticipatory&nbsp; governance has also been applied on the one hand, to deal with other emerging technologies such as carbon nanotubes&nbsp;(Philbrick 2010), geoengineering, synthetic biology&nbsp;(Wiek 2012), solar radiation management (Low 2017). On the other hand, this is contextualized through social objectives,&nbsp; such as avoiding climate change or urban development.</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Participation in governance of emerging technologies</h2><div>Governance of emerging technologies is an increasingly multi-actor exercise. In particular, citizens and civil society actors are expected to participate in the development of emerging technologies from an early stage ('upstream' engagement) <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>. In general terms, actors can be divided into government actors, industry actors and civil society actors. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Wiek_2007}</cite> expand this categorization to include 10 types of actors in the case of nanotechnology: industry, consultants, insurers, investors, public research institutes, government regulatory agencies, government research funding agencies, NGOs and media. In any case, the actor network is complex.</div><div>The three pillars of anticipatory governance (foresight, engagement and integration) were mentioned earlier. This section focuses specifically on the engagement part, raising key themes and issues that were found in the literature search. Engagement is a rising trend in anticipatory governance of emerging technologies, at least on the level of discourse.&nbsp;In recent decades, participation in governance of technologies has evolved from increasing the public's level of knowledge, a one-way educating activity, into engaging the public in a two-way dialogue&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flear_2012}</cite>. <cite

uncertainty of future consequences. Even though technology experts are 
involved in the process, nobody can claim to know with certainty the 
long-term consequences of developing technology in a particular 
direction. In this context, a distinction is often made between&nbsp;<i>risk,</i> where the probabilities of possible outcomes are known or predictable, and&nbsp;<i>uncertainty</i>, where probabilities are unknown. In anticipatory governance, we are dealing with techno-scientific expectations which are future-oriented abstractions: intentions, goals, hopes and proposals&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lucivero_2011}</cite>.</div><div>To leap from such uncertain expectations to firm judgments is problematic. In anticipatory governance, this is particularly challenging because such uncertain anticipatory knowledge is intended as justification for making decisions and taking certain actions in the present. How can decision-makers take decisive steps based on uncertain anticipatory knowledge?</div><div>Making claims about future states is problematic from an epistemological point of view, as futures researchers have acknowledged for decades. There is a kind of triple uncertainty involved: firstly, we cannot predict future outcomes; secondly, we cannot always know what is a good future; and thirdly, we do not know what actions should be taken to reach this future&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>. These problems were already noted by Malaska, who asked to what extent futures are knowable, to what extent we can shape the course of the future, and to what extent we can choose aims and goals according to our values&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Malaska_2001}</cite>. Outcomes of technologies regarding culture and society are particularly 
uncertain. Potential societal issues are not simply 'out there' to be found, but 
they co-evolve in the interplay between technology development and its 
use by societal actors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>. To some extent, futurists themselves are creating and promoting social issues by articulating them, that is, 'speaking them into existence'.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite> argue that uncertain normative claims must be translated in order to be comprehensible to other stakeholders in discourse, and suggest Habermas' discourse ethics as a framework that can solve the problem of uncertainty in making normative future claims. In practice, they suggest breaking normative claims into constituent parts and questioning the validity of each part in discourse. The underlying notion is similar to the epistemic implication model that Wendell Bell discusses: the evidence base for normative claims should be made explicit and questioned <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{bell1997foundations}</cite>.</div><div>In a similar manner,&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Lucivero_2011}</cite> argue that statements about expectations can be broken down into three types of claims: about characteristics and functioning of technology, about how technology will be adopted and integrated into practice, and about how technology will address a social problem or need. The implication is that discussion on societal aspects of technology need to assess not only technical feasibility but also usability and desirability of expected technologies. The third aspect is perhaps the most challenging, because morality evolves over time and the public perception of future technologies is difficult to assess beforehand.

This perspective raises a challenge for anticipatory governance: how deep should public participation be? It is relatively easy to identify relevant NGOs and civil society organizations, but it is more difficult to identify more amorphous publics that emerge around specific concerns. In practical terms, who should be invited to a workshop on a technology that concerns practically everyone?</div><div>Perhaps an even more challenging issue is how 'the public' can be consulted in an anticipatory manner, if issue-oriented publics for future issues have not yet been formed. In theory, the workshop organizer would need to anticipate which individuals and groups may become part of the concerned group regarding a certain technology, but there is clearly a significant risk of mistakes.</div><div><b>Theme: positive benefits / negative risks: </b>Important theme because this defines the knowledge interest in the foresight study.</div><div></div><div><b>Theme: increasing reflexivity in science and innovation:</b> e.g.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{barben_anticipatory_2008}</cite></div><div>Critics have pointed out that the perspective of anticipatory governance may contribute to the hubris of technoscience <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Boenink_2013,Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Ethics is connected to anticipatory governance of emerging technologies in two ways.
