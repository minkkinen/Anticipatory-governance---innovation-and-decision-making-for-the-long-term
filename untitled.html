Guston defines anticipatory governance as a "broad-based capacity extended through society that can act on a variety oof inputs to manage emerging knowledge-based technologies while such management is still possible" <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>. The starting point is the so-called Collingridge dilemma: first the social consequences of emerging technologies are unclear, and when they become clearer, it is already too late to act on them due to path-dependence and technological lock-in. The basic assumption is the one shared in all foresight work, that early anticipatory action is better than reacting when problems and crises have already emerged. Therefore government agencies and technology developers are increasingly expected to anticipate possible consequences of technology development and to make informed decisions.</div><div>Of course, the key challenge in anticipatory governance is the uncertainty of future consequences. Even though technology experts are involved in the process, nobody can claim to know with certainty the long-term consequences of developing technology in a particular direction.</div><div>Anticipatory governance aims to build capacities in foresight, engagement and integration <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>In the early 2000s, two strands of literature in anticipatory governance began to emerge: 1) public administration and management, and 2) environmental studies and policy <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Critics have pointed out that the perspective of anticipatory governance may contribute to the hubris of technoscience <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Boenink_2013,Guston_2014}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Ethics is connected to anticipatory governance of emerging technologies in two ways. Firstly, the foresight exercises try to uncover possible future ethical and social issues related to the technology in question. Ethics is thus the connected to the substance of the foresight. Secondly, there are many ethical questions related to the foresight methods that are used, such as stakeholder participation and the use of power. This is the methodological or meta-level ethical element.</div><div></div><div>Barben D&nbsp;Fisher E&nbsp;Selin C&nbsp;Guston DH&nbsp;(2008)&nbsp;Anticipatory governance of nanotechnology: Foresight engagement and integration.
