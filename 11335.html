Anticipatory governance is divided into the dimensions of foresight, engagement and integration. Scenarios are central to anticipatory governance also from this perspective because they relate to both the foresight and engagement aspects.</div><div>However, the focus in the scenario approaches can differ. Some scenario studies emphasize systematic foresight, others focus more on engagement.
