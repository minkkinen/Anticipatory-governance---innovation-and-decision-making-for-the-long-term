This is, perhaps, roughly what Poli (2009) means, when he suggests that&nbsp;anticipatory systems could have a capacity to even anticipate their own evolution.&nbsp;Anticipatory governance, which we have discussed more in detail, we can then derive, may be defined by two levels. In its inner core, perhaps less addressed in the literature, is an&nbsp;'idea' or an ideal of how innovations 'should be'. This&nbsp; reminds of work by Lucas and Fuller’s (2017) work on entrepreneurship; they see&nbsp; that we may categorize entrepreneurship into ‘productive’ or ‘unproductive’ – &nbsp;even if it is not always clear – relative to what.&nbsp;Such ideals are sought, in more&nbsp;practical terms,&nbsp;with anticipatory governance. &nbsp;Anticipatory governance explores innovation processes (or scientific discovery) by reflecting them with societal expectations, ideally in light of the (even unexpected) implications that may emerge from the uptake of emerging technologies. There is a limitation in conventional risk&nbsp;assessments of emerging technologies when they only address social and environmental risk and hazard. A&nbsp;<span>prospective assessment should ask ‘what if’ and ‘how could’ questions (and move beyond forecasting) (Myers 2007). Problematically, many of the effects of a technology, and how innovations and&nbsp; technologies come to shape ‘reality’, are only known afterwards.</span></div><div>The basic issue regarding anticipatory governance of emerging technologies is how to facilitate discourse between different actors: technology developers, researchers, governments, civil society actors and citizens. There seems to be consensus that broad stakeholder participation is needed, but the practical implementation of this participation is faces many difficult challenges, including identifying possible future ethical problems, engaging the public in an appropriate manner and balancing contradictory knowledge claims about the future.</div><div>The challenges of anticipatory governance of technologies largely stem from the uncertainty that is inherent in the exercise. Future outcomes of scientific developments are uncertain, the issues that may emerge are unclear, it is unclear how to define the 'public' that should be consulted, and so on.</div><div>The appeal to Habermasian discourse ethics is promising, but what if after informed and honest discussion, we simply cannot agree on the possible future, the good future, necessary actions or all three?</div><div>As its motivation is about ‘governing’, anticipatory governance lacks a certain ‘creative’  (Yunus 2015) feel, inherent with the process of innovation and discovery,  As a potential shortcoming, anticipatory governance seems to have addressed mainly the emergence of individual technologies (or groups of technologies) and engaged less with potential convergences of emerging technologies (see e.g.&nbsp; Glenn et al. 2015, Song et al. 2017) and broader (even speculative) paradigm shifts. Anticipatory governance could also be adapted to address more explicicomprehensively) socio-ecological resilience. In this task, anticipation should escape narrow&nbsp; definitions and draw from futures studies (Boyd et al. 2015). One paper finds that</div><div>One significant issue is the role that futures research could play in enabling anticipatory governance. The futures field is rarely mentioned in articles on these topics, even though the challenges, such as tackling complexity and uncertainty and ensuring fair and productive workshop practices, are similar in futures research and anticipatory governance. Could futures research play the kind of 'third party' role which authors have suggested as necessary&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krabbenborg_2015,Mittelstadt_2015a}</cite>?&nbsp;</div><div>Anticipatory governance is related to the grand challenges of our times, since technology plays an increasingly dominant role in our lives and in solving both large and small problems. For <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet*{Krabbenborg_2015}</cite>, creating better public engagement in technology development means nothing less than shaping our society in a more reflexive manner. Similarly,&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Flear_2012}</cite> argue that norms and values promoting a truly democratic European Union and a public consisting of reflexive agents need to be designed into the processes of participation.</div><div>However, anticipatory governance for sustainability is only sporadically mentioned, in spite of tackling risk and uncertainty.
